                    <td><b>Step 1:</b> Web Scraping
                    Using Python and libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests, I developed a script to scrape data from a targeted website. The script efficiently navigates through HTML elements to extract relevant information, such as product details, prices, or user reviews.<br>
                    <b>Step 2:</b>Data Transformation to CSV
                    The extracted data is then cleaned and organized into a structured format using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. This includes handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring consistency. The cleaned data is saved into a CSV file, which serves as a portable and widely-accepted format for data exchange.<br>
                    <b>Step 3:</b>Data Visualization with Power BI
                    The CSV file is imported into Power BI, a robust data visualization tool. In Power BI, I create interactive dashboards and reports to analyze the scraped data. These visualizations provide insights and help identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data, making it easier to derive actionable intelligence.<br><b>Languages:</b>HTML,CSS,JS,python</td>

These devices are essential in various applications, including power monitoring, industrial automation, and electrical safety systems.
